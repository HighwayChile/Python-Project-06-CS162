Sorting visualizer with selection, bubble, and merge sort options.

Hello, There is a single module version and also one that is split into two
modules, including a SortList class.

Both versions work okay, the single module tends to crash, and the split 
version accepts multiple inputs when I do not want it to. But the sorting 
aspect works if reset, then run again.

JUMBLE creates a new list
SELECTION sorts the list select-style
BUBBLE sorts the list bubble-style
MERGE sorts teh list merge-style

Use the slider to select number of bars, then hit JUMBLE to generate that new
list

Use dropdown menu to choose speed.
